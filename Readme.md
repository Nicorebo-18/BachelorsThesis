# Enhanced Intelligent Autonomous Robot

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains resources for maintaining and performing necessary repairs on my thesis project, defended on June 26th, 2024, during my Erasmus at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB). The project aims to enhance the capabilities of an existing robot, originally developed as part of my thesis. This improved robot serves as an advanced platform for educational purposes and research activities within the university community. By upgrading its functionality, robustness, and performance, the goal is to provide students and professors with a versatile tool for exploring concepts in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence (AI).

## Key Objectives
- **Educational Tool** üéì: The upgraded robot will offer students hands-on experience in designing, programming, and testing autonomous systems. This prepares them for careers in engineering and technology by leveraging practical applications of theoretical knowledge.
  
- **Research Platform** üß†: Professors and researchers across various disciplines can utilize the robot to conduct experiments in machine learning, computer vision, and human-robot interaction. Its sensors and capabilities support accurate state estimation and facilitate the development of new robotic applications.

- **Versatility and Mobility** ü§ñ: Equipped with omnidirectional wheels and a suction cup arm, the robot demonstrates high mobility and precise maneuverability. This makes it suitable for navigating diverse environments and manipulating objects effectively without the complexity of multi-fingered grippers.

- **Sensor Integration** üì°: The robot incorporates essential sensors such as distance sensors, wheel encoders, accelerometers, and a camera. These sensors enable tasks ranging from basic object detection to advanced challenges like Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), crucial for autonomous navigation and interaction with its surroundings.

- **Modular Design** üõ†Ô∏è: Designed with modularity in mind, the robot allows for easy integration of additional components like grippers or specialized sensors. This enhances its adaptability for future research needs and technological advancements.

## Practical Applications
The enhanced robot will be utilized in:
- **Classroom Settings** üè´: Enriching educational experiences by providing practical demonstrations and hands-on projects for students.
  
- **Research Labs** üß™: Supporting research initiatives across multiple fields by serving as a testbed for algorithms and experimental setups.

- **Outreach and Events** üåç: Showcasing during campus events, open days, and STEM workshops to inspire interest in robotics among prospective students and the wider community.

- **Competitions and Exhibitions** üèÜ: Representing VUB in robotics competitions and exhibitions, highlighting the university's dedication to innovative research and education in robotics.

By improving the robot's capabilities and expanding its applications, this project aims to foster a vibrant environment for learning, research, and outreach within VUB. The enhanced platform will empower students to explore cutting-edge technologies while facilitating groundbreaking research in autonomous robotics and AI.
